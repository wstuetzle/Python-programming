uestions / issues regarding use of Python to teach Intro Data Science
======================================================================

* Functions vs methods
  - Use of methods for objects that are not instances of classes
  - No obvious criteria for choice between methods and functions

* Modules
  Students need to remember whihc functions / data structures are in
  which modules

* Indexing
  Lists can't be indexed with "range":
    the_list[range(5)] does not work - has to use
    the_list[0:5]
  Arrays can
    a = np.array(range(10))
    a[range(0, 5)]  works

* Data frames seem complex - three different ways of indexing
